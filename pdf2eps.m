%PDF2EPS  Convert a pdf file to eps format using pdftops
%
% Examples:
%   pdf2eps source dest
%
% This function converts a pdf file to eps format.
%
% This function requires that you have pdftops, from the Xpdf suite of
% functions, installed on your system. This can be downloaded from:
% http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf  
%
%IN:
%   source - filename of the source pdf file to convert. The filename is
%            assumed to already have the extension ".pdf".
%   dest - filename of the destination eps file. The filename is assumed to
%          already have the extension ".eps".
